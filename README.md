# EXCEL2CSV

Hi there, this is a sample code to extract the data from multiple Excel file and save it in a single .csv file.

To use this script, you need to have the pandas library installed. You can install it by running ```pip install pandas``` in your command prompt or terminal.

Please make sure to replace '/path/to/excel/files/*.xlsx' with the actual path to the directory containing your Excel files. Similarly, replace '/path/to/save/result.csv' with the desired path to save the resulting CSV file.

When you run the script, it will read all the Excel files in the specified directory, consolidate the data into a single dataframe, and save it as a CSV file. Finally, it will print a success message indicating the location where the CSV file has been saved.

Remember to adjust the script based on your specific needs, such as handling different file extensions or specifying custom formatting options.

Hope you find it useful for your project :) ;)
